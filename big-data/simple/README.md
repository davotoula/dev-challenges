### Introduction
A simple approach where the solution is contained in as single routine and all execution is synchronous.

### Approach
The implementation has been seperated into multiple helper functions to make it more modular but it all executes synchronously as no separate threads / routines are started.

### Results

In summary this simple solution performs better than the solution with channels. I suspect that for a simple problem like this, the channel overhead is not worth it.

For a more cpu intensive task I believe the channel overhead would be compensated by having multiple cores diving the workload.

Worse if multiple cores are used
