### Introduction
An approach that is using asynchronous concurrent go routines and communication and synchronisation via go channels.

### Approach
The problem has been divided into multiple steps in a pipe-line: 
 * read line
 * do currency conversion if necessary
 * group and calculate sum
 
Closing a channel is used as a signal for the next step in the pipe-line that there is no more to process and the routine should exit.

One final signal channel is used to signal to the main process that output is finished and the application can terminate

### Results

10,000,000 transactions and 1,000 unique partners.

Slower than the simple solution.

Even worse if multiple cores are used.
